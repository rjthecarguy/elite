<p>Rose McCoppin has owned and operated Elite Maintenance (Formerly known as Rose Maintenance Service) in Los Angeles since 1984.</p>

<p>Born in Adana, Turkey to a typical conservative 1960s Turkish family Rose realized that she did not fit the mold of the typical Turkish women and at the age of eighteen she left for England to have her college education. During her college years, she worked as a chambermaid gaining her first exposure to cleaning industry.</p>

<p>During a short visit to Los Angeles her valuables and plane tickets were stolen from her hotel room and unbeknownst to her at the time it was the major event that marked the beginning of her entrepreneurial and family life in United States! She started working at a convenience store temporarily to generate funds for going back; however she ended up settling down instead as she met the father of her children.</p>

<p>It was during the early days of motherhood that Rose came to realize “there were no professional and reliable cleaning companies” out there so she began cleaning homes as “Rose Maintenance”. Her goal was establishing a small and manageable business however referrals kept pouring in and over the course of the years Rose Maintenance proved to be much more than a one-man operation with 100 + employees, a high-profile customer portfolio and an excellent reputation in Los Angeles area!</p>
